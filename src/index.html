            <p>I was born and raised in Ndurumo Village,Nyamira county.I have four siblings of which one is dissappointingly a serious drunkard.I have been raised surrounded by an impoverished community whereby children's education is cut short by lack of school fees.From a young age i knew quite well that i did not want to write the same story as of people around me.So i gave it my all in education as i went through Eronge Adventist Primary School and the Alliance Girls' High School.I have been a successful student due to my dedication and hardwork and i hope for a brighter </p>
