            <h2>My Background</h2>
            <p>I was born and raised in Ndurumo Village,Nyamira county.I have four siblings of which one is dissappointingly a serious drunkard.I have been raised surrounded by an impoverished community whereby children's education is cut short by lack of school fees.From a young age i knew quite well that i did not want to write the same story as of people around me.So i gave it my all in education as i went through Eronge Adventist Primary School and the Alliance Girls' High School.I have been a successful student due to my dedication and hardwork and i hope for a brighter </p>
            <h2>Why I decided to learn programming with DirectEd</h2>
            <p>I have always had a passion for coding and in my next step of education i desire to pursue computer science in Harvad.In January,i really desired to join Moringa School but my parents could not afford the fee of around ksh.200000.That's hell a lot!So basicall DirectEd saved me.Thanks btw☺️.Its amazing how am learning programming for free basically</p>
            <h2>My current interests hobbies and skills</h2>
            <p>I'm enjoyong crocheting,baking and reading novels especially African where fufu is mentioned.I also have interest in discovering technology,like the other day we used kahoot and it really amazed me.</p>
